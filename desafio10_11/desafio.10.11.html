            <p class="paragrafo">
            When people think of the most iconic city in the United States, New York City is
            what comes to mind. As the most populous city in the country (8.5 million people),
            New York City has the world's two largest stock exchanges and is known for
            having some of the world's most renowned educational facilities.

            <h2>Central Park</h2>
            <p class="paragrafo">
            Found in the midst of
            Manhattan island, Central Park
            covers around 3.5 square
            miles and stretches across
            843 acres of land

            <h2>Empire State Building</h2>
            <p class="paragrafo">        
            On a clear day, the Empire State
            Building offers 80 miles of
            visibility, allowing you to see
            New York, Connecticut,
            Massachusetts, New Jersey
            and Pennsylvania.

            <h2>Times Square</h2>
            <p class="paragrafo">
            Formerly named Longacre
            Square, it was renamed in April
            1904 after the New York Times
            moved its headquarters to the
            Times Building, now called One
            Times Square.

            Just like the rest of New York
            City, Central Park has been
            featured in over 350 films and
            counting over the years. That's
            why it holds the title of most
            filmed public park in the world.

            The top of the Empire State
            Building is used for
            broadcasting the majority of
            commercial TV stations and FM
            radio stations in New York City.

            Nicknames include 'The
            Crossroads of the World' and
            reportedly 'The Tenderloin'
            because it was supposedly the
            most desirable location in
            Manhattan in the 1920s.
